## Solana Kaizen Project

This organization wraps repositories related to the Solana Kaizen project, an initiative spearheaded by [ASPECTRON](https://aspectron.com) to build a pure Rust-based platform-neutral Solana program and web application framework.  The Solana Kaizen project is based on the Rust [`workflow-rs`](https://github.com/workflow-rs/workflow-rs) framework that allows platform-neutral development of Rust APIs and applications.
